## Metasystem
The [Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Governance Framework (STM-GF)]() provides the legal governance for all participating entities within the Sovrin ToIP Metasystem (STM) or **Sovrin Ecosystem**. The STM is comprised of DID Ledgers ("Peer-Nets") that are either part of the Sovrin Network (did:sov) or a trusted DID Ledger associated with a unique DID Root Namespace.

## Sovrin Network
A collection of Peer-Nets that all adhere to the STM-GF but are managed as independent Identity Utilities each having its own Governance framework. Minimally there are two Peer-Nets within the Sovrin Network:

* Sovrin Public Utility (*did:sov:pub*)
* Sovrin Business Utility (*did:sov:biz*)

## Sovrin Public Utility

Circa 2019, the Sovrin Foundation and Sovrin Network were focused on a single DID Ledger, know as *MainNet*, and associated with *did:sov* Root DID Namespace. These responsibilities were outlined by the Sovrin Governance Framework V2 (SGFv2)](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/).

Today, the Sovrin Foundation has the following responsibilities:

* Maintenance and deployment of the [Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Governance Framework (STM-GF)]()
* Maintenance and deployment of the Sovrin Governance Framework V3 (SGFV3)](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/)
* Operation and management of the *Sovrin Public Utility*, which used  to be *MainNet* and is now associated with *did:sov:pub*.
* Managing The *Sovrin Alliance*
* Providing **Sovrin Foundation Services** to consortium that operate Peer-Nets within the Sovrin Network or as Trusted Remote Peer-Nets.

[Sovrin Governance Framework (SF-GF)](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/) is the legal foundation for the Public DID Ledger that serves as a global public utility for self-sovereign identity and is governed by the [Sovrin Foundation Board of Trustees(SF-BoT)](). The SFGFV3 is developed by the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group(SGFWG), currently chaired by Sovrin trustee Drummond Reed. Each new version is approved by the SF-BoT to become the official set of governance documents for the operation of the Sovrin Public Ledger (did:sov:pub).

Sovrin Governance Framework V2, was approved by the Sovrin BoT on 27 March 2019 and is now in a transition to V3 where it will be associated with a specific DID Ledger and in compliance with the STM-GF V1, which is currently under development.
