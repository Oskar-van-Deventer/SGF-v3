Dear XXXXXXXX:

Based on prior conversations with your organization with respect to its interest in a public decentralized identity utility, please accept this invitation for <ORG_NAME> to join a new business consortium and take one of the two actions specified herein by 15-Nov-2019.

Purpose
--------------------
We seek to quickly establish a consortium of members that will partake in the creation of a governance framework for a dedicated decentralized identity utility that businesses can comfortably participate in and reliably use.

Proposal
--------------------
Sovrin Foundation will serve as an Identity Utility Administrator for a new Identity Utility Network that is governed by the new business consortium. As a fee-based provider of administration services the Sovrin Foundation will provide operational, maintenance, and delivery services for the new DID Ledger under the did:sov root namespace. This new ledger,  did:sov:biz, will operate as a public identity utility provider under its own governance framework. A consortium of members will pay annual membership fees and provide supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility.

Opportunity
--------------------
Your organization along with other prospective consortium members have been identified as prospective candidates for one or more roles within the new business consortium. This invitation represents your chance to participate in and shape an enterprise grade governance framework that will:

* Enforce Permissioned Writes with contractual instruments that will ease GDPR concerns
* Establish financial sustainability of the Consortium without the use of Tokens
* Establish a governing board so no single organization owns the DID Ledger
* Require adherences to a specific stack of open standards and protocols

Membership Options
--------------------
1.	Founding Members: A limited number of initial members will contribute to the infrastructure, management, and financial needs of the public identity utility. They will serve on the Board of Directors and have the privilege of acting as a Trust Anchor with unlimited write transactions to the DID Ledger.
2.  Stewards: A limited number of members will contribute to the infrastructure, management, and financial needs of the public identity utility. They will have the privilege of acting as a Trust Anchor with unlimited write transactions to the DID Ledger.
3.	Trust Anchors: An unlimited number of members that are willing to be responsible for the endorsement of transactions to the ledger. They are obligated to use consortium approved endorser software and accountable for vetting the entities performing write requests. Those members that are not Founders or Stewards, will subscribe to annual transaction plans.

Required Action
--------------------
1. Accept Invitation
  a. Agreed to Learn More: Reply to this email with suggested dates and attendees for a Personal WebMtg that will introduce the topic and process.
  b. Kickoff Summit: Interested Founding Members must plan to attend a face-to-face meeting with other members. This event will be used to present concepts, answer questions, obtain Letter-of-Intent (LOI) signatures, and establish a Governance Framework (GF) working group from those that sign the attached LOI. The initial goal for the working group will be to set a target date for the proposal of Version 1 of the GF and ratification of the initial consortium board.  

2. Reject Offer: Uncertain or uninterested candidates do not need to take any action.
