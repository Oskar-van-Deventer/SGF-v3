## DIBE Consortium Ledger Access Policies

### DECLARATION OF INTENT
The policies defined in this version of this document—in particular
those regarding Permissioned Write Access and Personal Data—have been adopted by the
DIBE Consortium  during the period required to transition from the current policy of
Permissioned Write Access to the new policy of Public Write Access as defined in this
document. The DIBE Consortium Foundation intends to accomplish this transition as soon as the relevant
regulatory reviews can be completed.

### RECOMMENDED READING
The terms used in this Controlled Document are more fully
explained, including a visual diagram, on the Data Protection Regulation page of the Sovrin
Foundation website.
1. Transaction Author Agreement
1. The DIBE Consortium Foundation MUST:
a. Publish a Transaction Author Agreement between a Transaction Author and the
DIBE Consortium Foundation (representing the DIBE Consortium Network as a whole) specifying the
terms and conditions under which Transaction Authors agree to submit write
Transactions to the DIBE Consortium Ledger, including the policies defined in this
Controlled Document.
b. Publish a Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifying the
requirements for a Steward to serve as a Data Processor on behalf of
Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the DIBE Consortium Foundation as a
Designated Data Controller.
c. When necessary, revise the Transaction Author Agreement and the Steward
DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as specified in section 4
of the DIBE Consortium Governance Framework Master Document.

Steward DPA on the DIBE Consortium Foundation website and in the DIBE Consortium Code
Repository.
2. A Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit Transactions that contain:

b. Data that may not lawfully be written to the DIBE Consortium Ledger, where the definition of
applicable law in this context is provided in the Transaction Author Agreement.
3. Until such time as the DIBE Consortium Foundation implements Public Write Access, the
Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit a Transaction that contains Personal
Data.
4. A Transaction Author MUST agree that if it is determined in a court of law that one or
more Transactions made by the Transaction Author violated the terms and conditions of
the Transaction Author Agreement, the Transaction Author consents to the marking of
those Transactions with a Tombstone and, if possible, the revocation of the State
Proof(s) pertaining to the DIBE Consortium Ledger data for those Transactions.
2. Transaction Endorser Agreement
1. The DIBE Consortium Foundation MUST:
a. Publish a Transaction Endorser Agreement between the Transaction Endorser
and the DIBE Consortium Foundation specifying the terms and conditions under which
Transaction Endorsers agree to write Transactions to the DIBE Consortium Ledger,
including the policies defined in this Controlled Document.

the requirements for a Transaction Endorser to serve as a Data Processor on
behalf of Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the DIBE Consortium Foundation as
a Designated Data Controller.

Transaction Endorser DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as
specified in section 4 of the DIBE Consortium Governance Framework Master Document.
d. Publish the current version of the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the
Transaction Endorser DPA on the DIBE Consortium Foundation website and in the Sovrin
Code Repository.

3. Permissioned Write Access
1. The scope of the policies defined in this section is defined as follows:
a. The policies in this section MUST apply to the DIBE Consortium Main Network.

separately by the DIBE Consortium Technical Governance Board or other Controlled
Documents.
2. DIBE Consortium Trustees are permitted to write Transactions to the DIBE Consortium Ledger under the
following rules:
a. This policy MUST apply only to Trustees acting in their role as Trustees of the

been approved by a motion of the DIBE Consortium Board of Trustees.
i. Add or remove a Trustee.
ii. Add or remove a Steward.
iii. Add or remove a Transaction Endorser.

c. A Trustee MAY make DIBE Consortium Ledger maintenance Transactions if the Transaction
is approved by either the DIBE Consortium Board of Trustees, the DIBE Consortium Technical
Governance Board, or the DIBE Consortium Foundation Chief Technical Officer.
3. DIBE Consortium Stewards are automatically permitted to serve in the role of Transaction
Endorsers provided the Steward agrees to the Transaction Endorser Agreement by
submitting a physically or digitally signed copy to the DIBE Consortium Foundation.
4. Organizations other than Stewards are permitted to serve in the role of Transaction
Endorsers provided::
a. The Organization submits a Transaction Endorser application to the Sovrin

a. Each Transaction includes a valid digital signature from the Transaction Author.
b. The Transaction is endorsed by an approved Transaction Endorser.
c. If the Transaction updates the state of a ledger-persisted data structure, it MUST
be digitally signed by the same Transaction Author that recorded the previous
state.
4. Public Write Access
1. Public Write Access MUST enable a Transaction Author to submit a Transaction directly
to the DIBE Consortium Ledger without requiring the signature of a Transaction Endorser.
2. As soon as resources permit and relevant legal and policy questions are resolved, the
DIBE Consortium Foundation MUST:
a. Draft a revision to this Controlled Document defining the policies to enable Public
Write Access.
b. If necessary, draft a revision to the Transaction Author Agreement or any other
relevant Controlled Documents implementing the changes necessary to support
these policies.

Source Code necessary to implement these policies.
5. Public Read Access

DIBE Consortium Ledger unless marked by a Tombstone.
2. Once Tombstone functionality has been: a) implemented by the DIBE Consortium Community, b)
approved by the DIBE Consortium Technical Governance Board, and c) approved by the Sovrin
Board of Trustees, a Steward MAY mark a Transaction as a Node-Specific Tombstone if:
a. Requested by the Transaction Author of a Transaction for a valid reason as
specified by the Transaction Author Agreement.
b. Required of the Steward by a court order.
c. The Steward has evidence that the Transaction violates the terms and conditions
of the Transaction Author Agreement.

usage are published in a future version of this Controlled Document.
NOTE: Ledger-Wide Tombstones are not planned in the near future.
