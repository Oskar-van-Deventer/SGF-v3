## General Security Policies

1. A Steward MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral
to maintain protection of all services provided in association with the Sovrin Steward
Agreement (“Steward Services”). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees
of the Steward involved with providing the Steward Services. The Steward shall
designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies,
including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and
compliance enforcement.
2. A Steward MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such
policies as the Steward deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Steward
Services.
3. Because Node administrators are a potential threat vector, a Steward MUST maintain
and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires
involved with providing its Steward Services and will extend such requirements to
wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Steward Services. In accordance
with the Steward's internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be
periodically reviewed and include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks,
proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Steward.
Each Steward company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring
process as applicable and permitted under local law.
4. Employees of a Steward involved with providing its Steward Services MUST complete
security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with
the Steward's ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data
protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons
granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the
Steward's operation and support of its Steward Services.
5. If a Steward hosts its Node in its own data center, the Steward’s security policies MUST
also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best
practices.
6. If the Steward hosts its Node using a third-party Hosting Provider, the Steward MUST
ensure that the security, privacy, and data protection policies of the Hosting Provider
meet the requirements in this document.
7. A Steward MUST make available to the Sovrin Foundation upon request evidence of
stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the
Steward, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited
third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards.

## General Node Policies
A Steward Node:
1. MUST be available to run as a Validator Node or Observer Node on any of the formal
ledgers that make up the Sovrin Network.
2. MUST run a release of the Sovrin Open Source Code as approved and designated by
the Technical Governance Board (TGB).
3. MUST facilitate an upgrade to a new version of the Sovrin Open Source Code within
three (3) business days of a new release that has been: a) recommended by the Sovrin
TGB, and b) accepted by a vote of any other relevant Sovrin Governing Body (such as
the Steward Council).
4. MUST register all Node configuration data required by the Pool Ledger in a timely
manner, keeping information up to date within three (3) business days of changes.
5. MUST have at least two (2) IT-qualified persons assigned to administer the node, and at
least one other person that has adequate access and training to administer the Node in
an emergency, such as the network being unable to reach consensus or being under
attack. See the Sovrin Crisis Management Plan for details.
6. MUST supply contact info for all administrators to the Sovrin Foundation, whose
accuracy is tested at least quarterly (e.g., by sending an email and/or text that doesn’t
bounce).
7. MUST maintain a system backup or snapshot or image such that recovering the system
from failure could be expected to take one hour or less.

## Node Technical Policies
The following requirements apply to Steward Nodes on the Sovrin Main Network. Nodes on any
other Sovrin Test Network should be similar, but requirements may be downgraded from MUST
to SHOULD.
1. MUST run on robust server-class hardware.
2. If a Node is run on a VM, the Steward:
    1. MUST run on a mainstream hypervisor that receives timely patches from its
    vendor or community.
    2. SHOULD apply hypervisor patches on a regular basis.
3. The Node MUST run in an OS that is dedicated to the validator, i.e., a single-purpose
(physical or virtual) machine that MUST run Sovrin Open Source Code, MAY run other
software approved by the TGB, and MUST NOT run any other software. Software
required to support the node, such as monitoring, backup, and configuration
management software, are approved as a general category. However, Stewards should
discuss with the TGB any software packages that transmit between the Steward Node
and the outside.
4. MUST run a server with compatible versions of the operating systems supported by the
Hyperledger Indy Node requirements as documented in the release notes.
5. MUST have adequate compute power (in late 2019, 8 or more cores is considered
adequate).
6. MUST have adequate RAM (in late 2019, 32 GB of RAM is considered adequate).
7. MUST have at least 1 TB, with the ability to grow to 2 TB, of reliable (e.g., RAIDed) disk
space, with an adequately sized boot partition.
8. MUST have a high-speed connection to the internet with highly available, redundant
pipes (as of late 2019, 100 Mbps was considered adequate).
9. MUST have at least one dedicated NIC for Sovrin Validator Node consensus traffic, and
a different NIC to process external requests. Each NIC must have a stable, static,
world-routable IP address.
10. MUST be implemented in a way that does not endanger Sovrin’s high availability
architecture, which is pool-based rather than node-based. Nodes should not take more
responsibility for high availability than what is contemplated by the Node Selection
Algorithm. For example, they should listen at exactly one pair of network addresses (see
2.9 above), using exactly one set of keys to respond to Sovrin/Indy protocol traffic at any
one time, and adhere to a minimal failover recovery delay period specified by the Sovrin
Foundation (or 30 seconds if not specified).
11. MUST have a system clock that is demonstrably in sync with well-known NTP servers.
12. SHOULD have a power supply consistent with high availability systems.

## Node Security Policies
A Steward:
1. MUST maintain Steward keys on a separate machine from the machine that runs their
node. This machine, called the “CLI (Command Line Interface) system”, uses Steward
keys to authorize the Node to participate in the pool, and is thus the basis for trust for the
node and the Steward’s identity on the network. The CLI system is not required to have
high-end hardware, but in terms of IT best practices for security , it must meet or exceed
the standards for the Node (see following items).
2. MUST provide certification that their Node runs in a locked datacenter with appropriate
levels of security, including the specifications that they target (e.g., SSAE 16 type II
compliance; other standards may also be acceptable).
3. MUST assert that their Node is isolated from internal systems of a Steward (because the
Validator Node is publicly visible and thus an inappropriate candidate for access to
privileged internal networks).
4. MUST assert that their Node, and its underlying systems, uses state-of-the-art
authentication for remote access (at least SSH with key plus password plus source IP
firewall rule, and two-factor authentication wherever possible).
5. MUST NOT allow access (remote or local) to the Node or CLI systems by anyone other
than assigned admins.
6. MUST apply the latest security patches within one (1) week or less (24 hours or less is
recommended).
7. MUST attest that the Node runs on a server protected by a firewall that, at minimum:
    1. Disallows public ingress except on ports used by the Node software (different
    machines may choose to expose ledger features on different ports, so no
    standard port setup is required).
    1. Optionally enables SSH, Remote Desktop, and similar remote access tools but
    constrains ingress for these tools in some way that excludes the public but allows
    access for admins.
    1. Locks down egress ports to limit the ability to jump from Node to some other
    location.
8. MUST run the Steward security check tool as requested, and MUST receive TGB
approval of the results before the Node is authorized to participate in consensus.
9. MUST run the Steward security check tool from time to time as requested by the TGB
and provide the test results report to the TGB within three (3) business days.

## Node Operating Policies
A Steward:
1. MUST equip at least two (2) technical points of contact responsible for administering the
Steward Node with an SMS-capable device for alerting.
2. SHOULD aim to achieve at least 99.9% (three nines) uptime for their Node (this amounts
to about 1.4 minutes of downtime per day or 9 hours per year).
3. SHOULD coordinate downtime with other Stewards in advance via a mechanism as
determined from time to time by agreement between the Sovrin TGB and any other
relevant Sovrin Governing Body.

## Node Selection Algorithm
1. The selection of active Validator Nodes at any point in time, at least on the Sovrin Main
Network, MUST be governed by the Node Selection Algorithm as specified by the Sovrin
TGB.
2. Non-technical inputs or policy decisions implemented by the Node Selection Algorithm
MUST be approved by the Sovrin Board of Trustees.
3. At any point in time, the Node Selection Algorithm MUST represent the TGB’s best
efforts at designing an algorithm that applies the Core Principles of the Sovrin
Governance Framework. Recognizing the inherent tension and tradeoffs between some
of the Core Principles, the design of this algorithm should give priority to balancing:
    1. The Decentralization by Design principles, in particular the principles of Diffuse
    Trust and High Availability.
    2. The Security by Design principles, in particular the principles of System Diversity
    and Secure Failure.
4. A human-readable, understandable, and explainable description of the current design of
the algorithm as approved by the TGB MUST be published by the TGB in the official
Sovrin Code Repository and made publicly visible via a web page on the Sovrin
Foundation website.

## Permissioned Test Network Policies
1. On the Permissioned Test Network:
    1. Steward MUST operate at least one Node but MAY operate more than one Node.
    1. Any number of Nodes MAY be hosted the Steward's choice of Hosting Provider.
    1. It is NOT REQUIRED to run the Node Selection Algorithm.
2. All access to the Permissioned Test Network MUST be governed by Permissioned Write
Access (note that this does not permit Personal Data to be written).
3. To be a Transaction Endorser for the Permissioned Test Network, an Organization
MUST be either:
    1. The Sovrin Foundation.
    1. A Steward on the Permissioned Test Network.
    1. A Transaction Endorser authorized by Steward on the Permissioned Test
    Network.
4. If at any time for any reason Personal Data is discovered on the Permissioned Test
Network:
    1. The Sovrin Foundation MUST be notified immediately.
    1. Within 48 hours of notification, the Sovrin Foundation MUST reset the
    Permissioned Test Network to erase the Personal Data.

## Reporting Policies
1. A Steward MUST report to the responsible Sovrin Governing Body any substantive
change to the configuration or location of a Node within five (5) business days of the
change.
